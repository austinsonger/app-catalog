# Open Source SaaS Catalog

Welcome to the Open Source SaaS Catalog, your go-to directory for discovering and evaluating SaaS offerings!

## About The Project

This project is an open-source initiative to create a comprehensive catalog of Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, 
providing detailed information about each service. It's designed to help users and companies find the right
SaaS solutions for their needs.

## How To Use

Our catalog is structured in a simple data format for ease of use:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the service
- `name`: The official name of the SaaS offering
- `description`: A brief overview of the service provider and offerings
- `category`: The primary category the SaaS falls under
- `labels`: A set of relevant tags for the service
- `company`: Detailed company information
- `security`: Security features of the SaaS
- `compliance`: Compliance and certifications information
- `appDomains`: (if applicable) The service domains
- `oauthDisplayNames`: OAuth identifiers for the service

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have a SaaS offering you'd like to add or updates to 
existing entries, please follow the same format and create a PR. You can also suggest changes to the existing 
data in case of any errors or omissions.

## Data Collection Disclaimer

Our catalog is a collaborative effort, meticulously curated by our dedicated team and valued contributors.
We gather information directly from official OAuth application descriptions, such as those provided by 
"Login with Google", and by examining meta tags on associated websites. To enhance the quality and accuracy 
of our service descriptions and labels, we employ artificial intelligence technologies.

We strive for precision and comprehensiveness in our catalog. However, should you encounter any inaccuracies 
or missing information, we welcome your feedback. Your input is crucial to us in maintaining the 
integrity and utility of our resource.
